      AgriHub's mission is to enhance urban farming in Quezon City. The software tackles issues urban farmers encounter, like a lack of access to vital agricultural knowledge, resources, and marketing assistance. AgriHub strives to fill these knowledge gaps, create a supportive community among urban farmers, consumers, and agricultural experts, and boost the success of urban agriculture amidst the ongoing urbanization in Quezon City.
