          AgriHub's mission is to enhance urban farming in Quezon City. The
          software tackles issues urban farmers encounter, like a lack of access
          to vital agricultural knowledge, resources, and marketing assistance.
          AgriHub strives to fill these knowledge gaps, create a supportive
          community among urban farmers, consumers, and agricultural experts,
          and boost the success of urban agriculture amidst the ongoing
          urbanization in Quezon City.
