            "AgriHub" is a software being developed by the proponents, who are
            part of Quezon City and students of Quezon City University. The
            purpose of AgriHub is to address the challenges faced by urban
            farmers in Quezon City, including barriers in accessing agricultural
            knowledge and resources, limited support compared to rural
            counterparts, and difficulties in marketing products effectively.
            AgriHub aims to foster a sense of community among urban farmers,
            consumers, and agricultural experts, providing a platform to bridge
            the knowledge gap and enhance the growth and effectiveness of urban
            agriculture in the context of ongoing urbanization in Quezon City.
